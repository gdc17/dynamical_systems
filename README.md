# Dynamical Systems

Two jupyter notebooks used to investigate concepts from dynamical systems theory, including
- Initial exploration with logisitc map. Bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponent
- Introduction to ergodic theory using the logistic map as an example
- Sensitivity to initial conditions
- Density of periodic orbits 
- Explanation of issues caused by computational round-off errors
- Algorithm for finding a markov partition of a piecweise affine interval map
- Using the Ulam method for finding invariant measures of interval maps
